            <h2>SPORTSMANSHIP</h2>
            <p>The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire 
                youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, 
                team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from 
                this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey 
                background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.</p>

            <h2>IHF FIELD REGULATIONS</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>DIMENSIONS.IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within 
                a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be 
                adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older</li>
                <li>COMPETITION FIELDS. Fields used within the competition program must be 
                a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating in 
                the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these 
                minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will 
                assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board 
                whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams 
                from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable 
                field may be required to play all their games away</li>
                <li>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS 
                    <ol class="segList">

                to play their players 50% of each game.

                injuries</p>
